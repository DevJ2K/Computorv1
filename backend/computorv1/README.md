## Description

Computorv1 is a project aimed at building a simple equation-solving program. The program will focus on solving polynomial equations of the second degree or lower, using only exponents. The goal is to display the solutions of these equations clearly.

The program will handle the following tasks:

- Display the equation in its reduced form.
- Identify the degree of the equation.
- Show the solution(s) and, if applicable, the nature of the discriminant (positive, negative, or zero).

This project is a part of a series designed to refresh and strengthen mathematical skills, which will be useful for many future projects.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.10 or newer installed. You can download the latest version of Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DevJ2K/app_computorv1.git
    cd app_computorv1/backend/computorv1
    ```

2. **(Optional) Create a Virtual Environment:**

    It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    If there are any dependencies, you should list them in a `requirements.txt` file. Install them using:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Script

You can run the script in one of the following ways:

1. **Make the script executable:**

   ```bash
    chmod +x main.py
    ```

    Then execute it directly:

    ```bash
    ./main.py
    ```

2. **Using the Python command:**

    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

### Expected Output

Once the script is run successfully, you should see the following output:

```
It's work !
```

### Use Case

<!-- Provide examples or scenarios where your project could be used. For instance: -->

<!--# Example -->
```bash
./main.py
```
